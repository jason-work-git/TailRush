[Flowbite React](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react) is a free and open-source UI component library based on the core Flowbite components and built with React components and interactivity handling.

This library features hundreds of interactive elements such as navbars, dropdowns, modals, and sidebars all handled by React and based on the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

## Getting started

Learn how to get started with Flowbite React and start leveraging the interactive React components coupled with Flowbite and Tailwind CSS.

### Setup Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind CSS by following the [official installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

### Install Flowbite React

1. Run the following command to install `flowbite-react`:

```bash
npm i flowbite-react
```

2. Add the Flowbite React `content` path and `plugin` to `tailwind.config.js`:

```js {1,7,11}
const flowbite = require("flowbite-react/tailwind");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
    flowbite.content(),
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    flowbite.plugin(),
  ],
};
```

### Try it out

How you use Flowbite React depends on your project setup. In general, you can just import the components you want to use from `flowbite-react` and use them in a React `.jsx` or `.tsx` file:

```jsx
import { Button } from "flowbite-react";

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
